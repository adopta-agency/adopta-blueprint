<p>I wanted a meaningful project to kick off my Adopta.Agency work, something I have been wanting to see done for a while. When the White House released the budget, I worked to make machine readable, and I was pleased to find <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals">a list of spreadsheets available for the most recent budget</a>.</p>

<p>There is a lot of data continained within these 58 spreadsheets, regarding how our government works. I feel pretty strongly, that for us to better understand our government, we need easy access to this data for visualizations, storytelling, and other daily aspects of how our society works.</p>

<p>As with all Adopta.Agency projects, I am starting with making the data available via CSV and JSON files, via Github--building on the existing spreadsheets available. Next I am publishing APIs for quicker access to the historical data.</p>

<p>Finally, I will be pushing forward my own work, and encouraging conversation around this dataset, and hopefully make it easier to use, and have a bigger impact. I will be telling the story along the way, on this blog.</p>
